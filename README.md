# react-osx-dock

This repo contains a simple animation replicating the magnification on hover effect seen in OSX Dock Menu.

Take a look at [the demo](http://framer-motion-osx-dock.surge.sh/)

It's built using [framer-motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) (v2) and some other small utilities like [@rooks/raf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rooks/use-raf).

There is a [blog post](https://able.bio/drenther/creating-macos-dock-like-animation-in-react-using-framer-motion--2d5cbc0e) explaining the code.

Feel free to fork and star the repo if you like it. :)
